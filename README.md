# algorithm-composition
I wanna to create a system which can composing pop music by algorithm. Traditionally, the coders will create it by Markov or RNN. But I'm just thinking that could it be created by RNN and Markov together and combine them at last. Actually I'm an instrument player who is learning coding now. Connect with me if you are interesting in.
